Grading notes (if any)
----------------------
I joined the course late on 09/19, please excuse me from check-in #1 and #2. 

I've been in contact with Ms. Ascrizzi and Mr. Mickens, and I received an extension on check #2. I changed my entire schedule 3 days before Check in 2 was due, so I spent my time catching up in this class before being able to complete the PSET. I'm now caught up and am happy to use my late hours to complete this. Happy to be flexible, feel free to email me if anything comes up. Sorry for the inconvinience! 

Extra credit attempted (if any)
